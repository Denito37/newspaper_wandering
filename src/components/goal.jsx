                This is a digital newspaper with the goal of giving the
                user positive & interesting information that changes
                daily. When I created a dictionary website I added a
                word of the day component which kept me coming 
                back to that site to see the next word each day.
                this website, however, has that & more so I hope
                it’s able to hook users enough that they check back
                often.
