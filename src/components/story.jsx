                When creating this website I wanted it to be filled with 
                information that would interest me so I gather multiple 
                APIs & heavily filtered what news could appear on my
                site. In a way, this site is getting all of its content by 
                wandering all across the internet making it the 
                perfect adjective for this website. Scoops is just
                another word for news.
